# Technical Interview Practice

Hi there! My name's Natasha and welcome to my repository where I do all of my technical interview prep. Each file in this repo is a different whiteboarding or coding challenge question that I've encountered and documented. Almost all of the problems here are solved in Python 2.7 unless otherwise noted.

Each file is structured similarly with
* A description of the problem
* My first attempts at the problem (without help from the internet)
* Solutions after I looked up answers
* Additional notes
* Code to run doctests

Feel free to explore my solutions and suggest your own solutions. If you like the template that I've created for myself take a copy of it from [template.py](/template.py).

Running list of problems:
* [Print the Power Set of a Given Set](/printPowerSet.py)
* [Find the Missing Number in the Sequence](/missing_number.py)
* [How long is the longest sentence?](/longest_sentence.py)
